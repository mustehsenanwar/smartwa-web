For testing the website without actual images, you can use free placeholder image services:
- Use https://placeholder.com/ (e.g., https://via.placeholder.com/600x400)
- Use https://placehold.co/ for colored placeholders
- Or use images from https://undraw.co/ for professional-looking SVG illustrations
